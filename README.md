# ShelfHelp

- ShelfHelp is a webapp that is designed to make looking at books fun and easy.
- The current version of ShelfHelp uses local storage for books to be saved by users.
- This makes it easy for no account logons but limits user to browser keeping the data saved.
- Future updates will include more personalized home pages, links to books, notes for saved books, and a database for users to save books.

### Changelog starting June 11, 2025.

- 06/11/25 Moved app from create-react-app to Vite
- 06/16/25 Fixed react-slick issue and wishlsit bug.

#### About

- This project has been fun to develop and work with. I have made some mistakes along the way but I am slowly trying to clean them up along the way. I work a full time job and am a full time student. This leaves little room for my passion projects. I look forward to keep improving this app in the future.
