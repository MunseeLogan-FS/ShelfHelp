# ShelfHelp

- ShelfHelp is a webapp that is designed to make looking at books fun and easy.
- The current version of ShelfHelp uses local storage for books to be saved by users.
- This makes it easy for no account logons but limits user to browser keeping the data saved.
- Future updates will include more personalized home pages, links to books, notes for saved books, and a database for users to save books.
